We design genetic circuits
\ra{in \emph{E.~coli}}
that play the following game:
%
\begin{quote}
	Two players start with 15 sticks
	and alternatingly 
	take 1, 2 or 3 sticks.
	\\
	The last player to take a stick loses.
\end{quote}

%Because a player can complement
%the number of sticks taken by the opponent,

%The deterministic winning strategy
%of the first-mover
%in shown in Table \ref{t:logical-playera}.
%%
%We implement it for both players.

%



\subsection{General design} \label{s:general}

We encode in binary 
the number of sticks left as
\[
    \label{e:s0123}
    %
    \text{number of sticks left} = \ce{8 s_3 + 4 s_2 + 2 s_1 + s_0}
    .
\]
%
%
By the 4-periodicity of the winning strategy,
only the two lowest bits \ce{s_1}/\ce{s_0}
matter to the player.
%
%
The response of a player is a number 1, 2, or 3,
which we encode in binary as
\[
    \label{e:r01}
    %
    \text{number of sticks taken by a player} = \ce{2 r_1 + r_0}
    .
\]
%
The bits in \eqref{e:s0123}--\eqref{e:r01}
are transmitted 
between compute units
by 
intercellular signaling molecules,
cf.~\S\ref{ss:experiment}.
%
Although our players are essentially identical,
we model them separately with one difference:
Player A (B) becomes active when 
the extracellular signal \ce{w_A} (\ce{w_B}) is supplied.

%

The \emph{Subtractor} module
keeps track of the number of sticks left \eqref{e:s0123}.
To appreciate the key design issue, suppose
we manually transmit the response \ce{r_1 r_0 = 01}
of a player
into the medium of the subtractor.
It should compute the new number of the sticks,
yet, it has to do so once
and not keep subtracting the value \ce{r_1 r_0}
that is still present.
One solution is single-use subtractors
but then the result of each computation
has to be imparted to an unused one.
%
A feasible design
seems to require some separation of
reading/storing the current state,
computing the new state and communicating it
--
temporally or spatially.
%
%
%
We propose 
a subtractor composed of two parts A and B,
and
a workflow 
%of Phase A, Interphase, Phase B, Interphase, etc.,
as shown in Table \ref{t:workflow}.
%
%
%
Thus,
in Phase A characterized by the supply of 
the master signal \ce{w_A},
Subtractor A
emits the current state \ce{s},
Player A responds with \ce{r},
while
Subtractor B
reads \ce{s}/\ce{r}
and
computes the new state % \ce{s} 
{silently}
and remembers the result
in order to emit it in the subsequent Phase B.
%
%
We use the variables \ce{d_3}/\ce{d_2}/\ce{d_1}/\ce{d_0}
for this internal state.
%
%
The medium is cleared, before
Phase B is initiated by
supplying the master signal \ce{w_B}.
%
%
Briefly,
we require
a gated memory module and a delayed response,
cf.~\S\ref{ss:sub}.
%
%

%%% TABLE %%%
\input{t_workflow}



\subsection{Conventions}



%
As shown in Table \ref{t:signals},
we encode \ce{w_A} by L-arabinose,
\ce{w_B} by IPTG, etc.
%
Our convention is \ce{w_A = 1}
if 
the corresponding messenger molecule L-arabinose 
is present in the medium/cell 
in sufficiently high quantity,
and \ce{w_A = 0} otherwise.
%
We write \ce{\#w_A} for
the \emph{number} of L-arabinose molecules 
in the numerical simulations.
%
Where suitable,
we indicate the semantics of an element thus:
\signal{signal},
\protein{protein} -- often a transcription factor,
and
\promoter{promoter};
%
this is consistent with 
the symbols that we employ in
the SimBiology schemes.
%
By \signal{w_A} we mean 
``the signal molecule that encodes \ce{w_A}'',
i.e.~L-arabinose.
%
Ditto for the other signals.

%
%

Abbreviations:
RBS = ribosome binding site,
QS = quorum sensing,
AHL = acyl homoserine lactone,
txn = transcription,
tln = translation,
{3OC6} = {3OC6}{-}HSL (etc.),
SM = supplementary material,
DNF = disjunctive normal form.
% EC50 = half maximal effective concentration


\subsection{Logic circuits}


\subsubsection*{The players} \label{ss:players}

Both players
follow the same deterministic strategy,
which is a winning strategy for the first-mover.
%
They are identical except
that player A responds when \ce{w_A} is present
and player B responds upon \ce{w_B}.
%
The logic is shown in Table \ref{t:logical-playera}.


\subsubsection*{Subtractor} \label{ss:sub}


In Phase A,
Subtractor B 
senses the current number of sticks \eqref{e:s0123},
emitted by Subtractor A,
and 
the response \eqref{e:r01} from Player A,
and
computes the difference \ce{d}.
%
It has four compute units Bit~0 to Bit~3
that are also
spatially separated (cf.~\S\ref{ss:experiment}). 
%
The subtraction proceeds from Bit~0 to Bit~3
(cf.~Table~\ref{t:substeps}).
%
Bit~0 senses the current \ce{s_0}/\ce{r_0}
and computes \ce{d_0} (silently)
and the carry flag \ce{c_1} (emitted immediately).
%
The carry flag is passed on to Bit~1.
%
Bit~1 subtracts \ce{r_1} and \ce{c_1} from \ce{s_1}. 
%
The resulting carry flag \ce{c_2} 
is passed on to Bit~2, 
which subtracts \ce{c_2} from \ce{s_2}.
%
Then Bit~3 subtracts the resulting carry flag
\ce{c_3} from \ce{s_3}.
%
Each Bit 0/2/3
is in fact a ``half-subtractor'' with 2 inputs,
whilst
Bit~1 is a ``full subtractor'' with 3 inputs.
%
%
%
See
Table~\ref{t:subtractor1}
for their truth table.
%
Fig.~\ref{f:logical-subtractor01}
shows a reference logic circuit 
for Bit~0 and Bit~1
that illustrates the principle of delayed response.

%

\ra{
Since
Bits 0/2/3 
are technically a subfunctionality of Bit~1,
we will
omit their discussion and focus on Bit~1.
}

\subsection{Experimental design} \label{ss:experiment}

We distinguish
\emph{extracellular} chemical signals 
that are supplied by the experimenter
(the master signals \ce{w_A}/\ce{w_B})
and
\emph{intercellular} signals
that are produced and sensed by cells.
%
%
%
For an experiment in a single test tube 
we need
orthogonal intercellular channels:
\emph{three} for \eqref{e:s0123}
($s_3$ has no downstream),
\emph{two} for \eqref{e:r01},
and
\emph{three} for the carry flags
(see \S\ref{ss:sub}).
%
Thus we need \emph{eight} orthogonal intercellular channels,
cf.~Table \ref{t:substeps}.
%
One channel could be spared 
at the expense
of a more involved computation of 
the last useful carry flag~$c_3$.
%
\citet{DuETAL2020}
designed
ten de novo intercellular signaling pathways
and
optimized
four known QS pathways.
%
However,
only \emph{eight} worked well orthogonally
on the sensor level 
and 
seven on the promoter level
\cite[\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17993-w/figures/3}{Fig.~3c/g}]{DuETAL2020}.
%
We have assigned in Table~\ref{t:signals}
the signals
to minimize crosstalk,
in particular 
avoiding LuxR and RpaR in one cell,
heeding the advice in \cite[p.6]{DuETAL2020}.
%
%

%%% TABLE %%%
\input{t_signals.tex}


%

\ra{
To facilitate debugging
we partition the workflow
with spatial compartments
that require manual transmission of 
the medium.
%
%
Unfortunately, this does not automatically reduce
the number of intercellular channels needed.
}

\hh{The experiment setup includes 6 compartments, including two for Players (A and B) and four for the subtractor (computing units Bit 0 to 3). 
Note that in each computing unit, there are two sub-population of cells as Subtractor A and B.
%
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The experiment is initialized
by supplying
\signal{s_1}/\signal{s_0} to Player A, \signal{s_2} to Bit 2 and \signal{s_3} to Bit 3 (i.e the number of sticks is 15 to start with).
    \item The \ce{w_A} is added to Player A as the wake-up signal and trigger the computation in Player A. Here we assume that the consumption of \signal{w_A, s_0, s_1} is negligible (i.e, remain high concentration) during computation.
    \item The original medium from Player A (\ce{w_A, r_0, r_1, s_0, s_1}) is admixed to Bit 0; and the compartment Player A is washed and replaced with new medium (i.e, no w/s/r present). With \ce{w_A} present, Subtractor B in Bit 0 is now waken up and computes the difference \ce{d_0} but do not emit the signal \ce{d_0}. With \ce{r_0, s_0} present, Subtractor A in Bit 0 now computes the carrier flag \ce{c_1}. 
    \item The original medium from Bit 0 (\ce{w_A, r_0, r_1, s_0, s_1, c_1}) is admixed to Bit 1; the compartment Bit 0 is replaced with new medium. With \ce{w_A} present, Subtractor B in Bit 0 is now waken up and computes the difference \ce{d_1} silently. With \ce{r_1, s_1, c_1} present, Subtractor A in Bit 0 now computes the carrier flag \ce{c_2}.
    \item The original medium from Bit 1 is admixed to Bit 2; and cells in Bit 1 in now washed. Computation in Bit 2 is similar to Bit 1. The similar procedure is repeated for Bit 3.
    \item At the end of \textbf{Phase A} and \textbf{Interphase}, all players and computing units (Bit 0 ~ 3) is now in fresh medium with no signals w/s/r present. However, the Subtractor B in all computing units now contains the information of differences, i.e \ce{d_0, d_1, d_2} and \ce{d_3}). 
    \item The phase B starts by adding \signal{w_B} to the Player B and four computing units. When \signal{w_B} is present, all Subtractor B in Bit 0 to 3 now emit \ce{d}, which is now the new \ce{s}. The medium in Bit 0 and Bit 1 (with updated \ce{s_0, s_1}) is admixed to Player B. The following experiment steps repeat previous ones.
    \item The end of the game is marked that all signals \signal{s_0, s_1, s_2} and \signal{s_3} are zeros, i.e, all sticks are taken.

\end{enumerate}

We used their $\mathsf{0x0E}$ for \ce{r_0},
replacing the sensors 
and
replacing the repressor {PhlF}
(which clashes with the \ce{s_0} sensor) 
by {HlyIIR}
(also from \citep{NielsenETAL2016}).
%
The last operation
is a ``poor man's \OR gate'';
we let it produce \ce{cI^*}
(\S\ref{ss:cI})
that
triggers the synthesis of \signal{r_0}.
%
%
%
We observed that \ce{r_1} can reuse 
most of this circuitry
and implemented 
the remainder using ribocomputing
(details omitted).

%
%
For \ce{c_2}, we took
$\NOT \mathsf{0x8E}$,
replacing the sensors
and 
replacing the final 
``$\NOT (\NOT (\cdot) \OR \NOT (\cdot))$''
by
a ribo-\AND gate with cross-inhibition
(see \S\ref{ss:xinh}/p.\pageref{ss:xinh}).

\hh{In the construct of genetic circuit, insulator is often used to isolate different part of components. In the work of \cite{LouETAL2012}, a ribozyme-based insulator DNA sequence is inserted between the junction site and RBS. After transcription, the insulator mRNA forms a ribozyme structure that cuts off the leader sequence and scar downstream of +1 position. It also contains an additional hairpin structure, which helps to expose the RBS. The usage of insulator helps to prevent the interference of the upstream components to the downstream.}

\subsubsection*{3OC6} \label{ss:3OC6}
 
The transcription activator LuxR
occurs in Gram-negatives
such as 
\emph{V.~fischeri}%
\starlink{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliivibrio_fischeri}%
,
that is permeable to the (auto)inducer
3‐oxo‐C6‐homoserine lactone \signal{{3OC6}{-}{HSL}}.
%
%
It binds to the N-terminal of \protein{LuxR},
which otherwise inhibits its
functional C-terminal \cite{StevensDolanGreenberg1994}.
%
%
The purified C-terminal binds 
upstream of the \emph{lux} box 
(which is centered at $-42.5$bp \cite{EglandGreenberg1999});
however, 
together with the RNA Pol,
it protects the \emph{lux} box and the \emph{lux} operon
promoter
\cite{StevensDolanGreenberg1994}.

\subsubsection*{Sal} \label{ss:Sal}

According to 
\cite{SchellWender1986, HuangSchell1991},
the transcription activator \protein{NahR}
binds to the recognition site of \promoter{Sal} at
$-83$ to $-45$
without the inducer \cite[p.10837]{HuangSchell1991}.
%
%
In \cite{SchellBrownRaju1990},
it was suggested 
that the active configuration of \protein{NahR} is a tetramer,
while \cite{ParkLimShin2005}
reported that 
there could be three different complexes
$\protein{NahR} \with \promoter{Sal}$.
%
%
Possibly \cite{Peking2013},
$4 \times \protein{NahR}$ bind to the DNA,
and
transcription starts
once a $\signal{Sal}$
binds to each \protein{NahR}.
%
%Thus the inactive form of the promoter
%is $\protein{NahR}_4 \with \promoter{Sal}$.

in \cite[p.2]{DuETAL2020}.



\subsubsection*{NG} \label{ss:NG}

Naringenin (NG) is the main flavone from grapefruits
\citep{SiedlerETAL2014, iGEM14_TU_Darmstadt}.
%
It binds the homodimeric protein FdeR 
from \emph{H.~seropedicae}%
\starlink{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbaspirillum_seropedicae}%
. 
%
There are two slots for NG,
whose binding
induces a conformational change of the dimer. 
%
The activated FdeR promotes 
the ``Flavanone degradation'' operon \promoter{fdeA}.



\subsection{Memory module} \label{ss:memory}

As explained in \S\ref{s:general}
(cf.~Table~\ref{t:workflow}/\ref{t:subtractor1} and Fig.~\ref{f:logical-subtractor01}),
we need a memory module 
to record and recall the result of the subtraction.
%
To that end we use a ``reversible'' recombinase.
%
%
Specifically,
the Bxb1 gp35/gp47
serine-integrase/excisionase
(Int/Xis)
direct the infection cycle of Bxb1 
in
\emph{M.~smegmatis}%
\starlink{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_smegmatis}%
.
%
Stoichiometry, start codons,
degradation rates (proteolysis tags)
and DNA substrate copy number 
were optimized 
in \emph{E.~coli}
in \cite{BonnetSubsoontornEndy2012}
to 
assemble a memory bit
that is
stable and responsive over several generations.
%
A promoter of choice is flanked 
by Int recognition sites
and
its direction is 
\emph{set}
by Int
and 
\emph{reset}
by Int+Xis.
%
Switching times of $\sim$4h were demonstrated
but the authors expected 30min to be realistic.
%
Their final construct
\cite[Fig.~4A]{BonnetSubsoontornEndy2012}
consists of an Int gene 
and
a Xis+Int operon
induced by two separate signals,
which facilitates stoichiometry optimization.
%
However, 
in our design,
an external pulse (say, \signal{w_B}) controls Int,
and
an internal compute unit (say, \ce{s_0 \XOR r_0}) controls Xis.
%
The \emph{reset} state corresponds to 
positive output, i.e.~the memory bit is \emph{on}.
%
%
The flanked promoter is activated by another
external signal (say, \signal{w_A}).


\subsection{Enhanced \texorpdfstring{\AND}{AND} gate} \label{ss:and}

\subsubsection*{HrpR/HrpS} \label{ss:HrpRS}

\citet[\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms1516/figures/1}{Fig.~1}]{WangKitneyJolyBuck2011}

an \AND gate in \emph{E.~coli}
using the heterodimeric transcription factor 
$\ce{HrpR} \with \ce{HrpS}$
from 
\emph{P.~syringae}%
\starlink{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas_syringae}%
.
%
%The authors also estimated the parameters in 
%the Hill transfer function.
%
The dimer 
binds upstream of the promoter \ce{hrpL} 
and opens the $\ce{\sigma^{54}{-}RNAP{-}hrpL}$ transcription complex.
%
%
%
\ra{
The promoter is weak and saturates,
so increasing its copy number
improves the dynamic range
\cite[p.4]{Wong2015}.
}


\subsubsection*{Ribocomputing}

\citet[\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/nature23271/figures/2}{Fig.~2e}]{GreenETAL2017}
combined
two short input/sensor RNAs
\ce{A} and \ce{B}
into a ``trigger'' RNA
which opens an RBS-occluding stemloop
on the output mRNA.
%
%
%Let inputs \ce{A} and \ce{B} produce
%output \ce{mRNA_A} and \ce{mRNA_B}, resp.,
%whose RBS is auto-occluded by their own 5' tail.
%
%Let \ce{A} also produce a short RNA \ce{R^*_B} such that
%the 5' tail of \ce{mRNA_B} preferentially binds \ce{R^*_B},
%and vice versa.

\subsubsection*{Cross-inhibition} \label{ss:xinh}

\ra{
Even in our idealized simulations
such \AND gates produce undesired leakage
within larger circuits.
%
%
%
We propose that
\emph{low} input \ce{a} 
{inhibit} the downstream of \ce{b},
and vice versa:
%
we let $\ce{a} \act \ce{cI^a}$
and
$\ce{b} \act \ce{cI^b}$
produce
two orthogonal 
bidirectional
transcription factors as in \S\ref{ss:cI}.
%
They, in turn, 
activate \promoter{cI^a_+}/\promoter{cI^b_+}
and 
repress \promoter{cI^a_-}/\promoter{cI^b_-}:
%
%
\begin{align}
    \begin{rcases*}
        \ce{B^*} \reflectbox{\act} 
        \promoter{cI^a_-} \reflectbox{\rep} \protein{cI^a} \act \promoter{cI^a_+} 
        \act \ce{A}
        \\
        \ce{A^*} \reflectbox{\act} 
        \promoter{cI^b_-} \reflectbox{\rep} \protein{cI^b} \act \promoter{cI^b_+} 
        \act \ce{B}
    \end{rcases*}
    %
    \act 
    \stackrel{\hspace{-10pt}\smash{\text{trigger RNA}}\hspace{-10pt}}{\ce{AB}}
    \act 
    \begin{array}{c}
        \text{opens RBS on} \\ \text{the output RNA.}
    \end{array}

\ce{A} and \ce{B} 
combine to a trigger RNA \ce{AB} as in
\cite[\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/nature23271/figures/2}{Fig.~2e}]{GreenETAL2017},
and also have toeholds
for preferential binding to 
the complementary RNAs \ce{A^*} and \ce{B^*}.
%
%
The cross-inhibition is more effective
if
$\promoter{cI^a_-} > \promoter{cI^b_+}$
and
$\promoter{cI^b_-} > \promoter{cI^a_+}$
in terms of the output of the promoters.

	%$\ce{HrpR} \with \ce{HrpS}$ and $\ce{pchA} \with \ce{pchB}$

\TODO{Describe the Cas variant}


\subsection{Shelving}

We let 
\ra{a trigger RNA \ce{Y} with toehold}
encode \ce{d_1}
in the memory subunit
of Subtractor~A (cf.~\S\ref{ss:memory}).
%
It triggers the translation of \ce{Xis}.
%
%
Suppose
\ce{w_B = 1} and \ce{s_1 r_1 c_1 = 101},
in which case \ce{d_1 = 0}.
%
%
Then \ce{Y} is low,
but
around the timepoint when 
\ce{w_B} is turned off
and the inputs begin to change,
\ce{Y} can exhibit a transient bump
(which we observed in some simulations).
%
This is sufficient to produce \ce{Xis}
and thus to cause an unintended \emph{reset}.
%
We found two complementary ways to mitigate this.
%
One is to condition 
the expression of \ce{Xis}
on \ce{w_B} also,
which requires \ce{w_B} to go down early
and requires tuning of degradation rates.
%
We implemented another way,
which
is a ``shelf'' (a buffer) for \ce{Y}
that 
%
i)
has high affinity for \ce{Y};
%
ii)
sequesters 
about 
30$\times$EC50${}_\text{\ce{Y}\act\ce{Xis}}$
copies of \ce{Y};
%
iii)
is degraded when \ce{w_A} is on.
%
In this way, 
a transient increase in \ce{Y} is shelved
but a sustained signal 
(while \ce{w_B} is up)
will overflow the shelves and 
allow
translation of \ce{Xis}.
%
%
This is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{f:symbio-d1-tempo}.
%
%
%
%
As a concrete mechanism
we propose
transcription of 
a repeated complement of \ce{Y},
viz.~%
$
	\signal{\ce{w_A}} \act \protein{AraC^*} \act \promoter{BAD} 
	\act 
	\protein{cI} \rep \promoter{cI_-} \act
	\ce{[Y^*]^n}

\section{Simulations}

\subsection{General considerations}

Recall from \S\ref{ss:AmtR}
that 
the dimerized \protein{AmtR} represses \promoter{AmtR},
which we can express as
%
\[
	\ce{2 \protein{AmtR}} + \promoter{AmtR}_\text{active}
	\ce{<=>>}
	\protein{AmtR}_2 \with \promoter{AmtR}
	=
	\text{repressed state}
	.
\]
%
%
In steady state, we have the Hill equation
\[
	\promoter{AmtR}_\text{active}
	& =
	\left(
		1 + 
		(\protein{AmtR} / \text{EC50})^n
	\right)^{-1}
	\promoter{AmtR}_\text{total}
	.
\]
%
%
In case of an activator we use, for example,
\[
	\label{e:Sal}
	%
	\promoter{Sal}_\text{active}
	\ce{=}
	\left(
		1 +
		(\text{EC50} / \signal{Sal})^n
	\right)^{-1}
	\promoter{Sal}_\text{total}
	.
\]
%
%
All species are in units of \emph{molecules}.
%
For simplicity,
we use the above Hill equations
(which have no baseline term)
for all species with $n = 2$ 
and 
mostly $\text{EC50} = 1$ molecules.
%
%
\citet[SM:p.10]{NielsenETAL2016}
reported
$n = 1.6$ for an insulated AmtR
(with a certain RBS),
and higher coefficients for

We simulate expression and degradation
such that
typically
about $10$ molecules corresponds to the steady state,
for example
$
	\tfrac{\d}{\d{t}}
	\protein{Output}
	=
	k_+ \promoter{Sal}_\text{active} - k_- \protein{Output}
$
with
$k_+ = 1 \ce{s^{-1}}$
and
$k_- = 0.1 \ce{s^{-1}}$.
%
%
Generally,
we take $0.1$ and $10$ molecules to mean \emph{off} and \emph{on},
respectively.

        At the end of \ce{B_2},

\section*{Appendix}

\subsection{Subtractor module}

Fig.~\ref{f:logical-subtractor01} 
shows the principles of
the Subtractor module (bit 0 and bit 1),
but our implementation
differs in the details.
%
In particular, we use a reversible recombinase
for the memory module, see \S\ref{ss:memory}/p.\pageref{ss:memory}.

The result of the compute unit is written to the memory unit
(e.g.~a bistable switch)

%
The value of the memory unit is
forwarded to the output
when the signal \ce{w_A} is present.
